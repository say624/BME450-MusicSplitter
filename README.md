## Project decription
Max ½ page. Include some information on:
- what dataset you plan to use
- goal of the project. 

  The overall goal of our project is to develop a model that can identify the main musical instrument within a song/music file. This will be done by building a neural network that can classify the dominant instrument within a given audio file. The preliminary training dataset will have single-instrument tracks with instruments that have distinct auditory differences (ex. guitar, piano, violin, etc.) rather than similar instruments (violin, viola, etc.), which will be added later to increase model complexity if time allows.
  
  We plan to use Kaggle as a foundation for our training and testing datasets. We have already identified one dataset that will be used as a starting point (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/musical-instruments-sound-dataset), and will continue to search for datasets as we develop our model to improve its accuracy.
