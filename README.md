## Project decription
Once the user inputs a music file, the goal of this project is to:
  1. Separate vocals from backing track in music
  2. Identify the type of instruments used in a backing track
  3. Determine if two songs are compatible based on their BPM and key
We plan to use the following dataset from Kaggle to assist with musical instrument detection: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/musical-instruments-sound-dataset
